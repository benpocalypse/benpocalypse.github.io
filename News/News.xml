So you could have &amp;quot;Projects,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;News,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Journal&amp;quot; all being generated at the same time, each one with it's own Rss feed generation. I also need to link to the Rss file in the actual generated website, but that will come in the future.
Update: There was a bug in the code I pushed that had the &amp;quot;postsTitle&amp;quot; hardcoded to &amp;quot;posts&amp;quot; in the index.html generation, so even though Markerator generated things correctly, it wouldn't link to them correctly.
Update 2: Make that 2 hardcoded bugs ¯_(ツ)_/¯

It's been a long bumpy ride, but I believe after many, many visits with my various doctors, we've arrived at a root cause, and have a path forward that won't affect my ability to be productive and spend time with my family.
That being said, I plan on being much more productive this year. My wife is really good at writing down things on paper, and making lists and using calendars, but that's just not now my brain works. I mainly live in Obsidian MD, as I have a terrible memory, and that's the place that I tend to drop all my notes and stream of consciousness ideas. My rough outline for personal projects for the year, in no specific order are:
That's it for me...I'll continue to be here. Hope that 2024 finds you well.

My wife and I usually spend one night a week, after we put the kids to bed, having an &amp;quot;alone&amp;quot; night where I get to work on one of my 10 million projects, and she usually works on art or reads a book. Thanks to this, I'm finally getting some forward momentum on Markerator, as well as a game idea that the kids came up with.
I also treated myself to a cheap action cam &amp;quot;GoPro&amp;quot; knock off that I'm really enjoying. I've used it to film timelapses of the sunrise and sunset, timelapses of me driving, and awesome slow motion clips of the hummingbirds at the bird feeder. I have a lot of future plans for this thing, but so far I'm really enjoying it.
43 tomorrow.

This process turned out to be way more stressful and drawn out than I had expected, so most of my &amp;quot;free time&amp;quot; projects got shoved way, way back on the back burner. However, now that we've moved, and the house is starting to get somewhat organized, I've found some time to work on my personal projects - including this site, and Markerator.
With any luck I'll be updating this site more frequently and will make a habit of it. Fingers crossed.

I plan to refactor and add features to Markerator to make it fit for general consumption, but for now it suits my needs fairly well.
As I continue to work on this as well as other projects, I hope to keep the updates to the site flowing. Here's hoping.
