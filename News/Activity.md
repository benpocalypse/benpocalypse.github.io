## Activity!
It's been awhile, and I wanted to finally post an update.

Late last year/the beginning of this year, my family and I started the process of moving from the city, across states, out to the country. This process turned out to be way more stressful and drawn out than I had expected, so most of my "free time" projects got shoved way, way back on the back burner. However, now that we've moved, and the house is starting to get somewhat organized, I've found some time to work on my personal projects - including this site, and Markerator.

With any luck I'll be updating this site more frequently and will make a habit of it. Fingers crossed.
