<p>My name is Ben, and for as long as I've had access to a computer I've felt the compulsion to make projects with them. I'm roughly 42 years old, and have been a professional programmer by day, and a project-doer by night for most of my life. I mainly specialize in C#/.Net, but have done lots of C, C++, and Vala as well. I've also done plenty of assembly work for various processor architectures, but only when necessary. I love a great piece of software that does it's job well.</p>

<p>I'm a big Linux enthusiast, and have used some flavor of it as my primary desktop OS since the late 90's. My first love was Slackware, but after I got addicted to getting the latest releases of software I distro hopped for awhile. I used Ubuntu starting with Warty Warthog, but gave up on it when they pushed Unity as their primary desktop environment. Long story short, I ended up landing on elementary OS as my daily driver, and have been using it for the last ~7 years. It's a modern Linux distribution with a strong emphasis on a consistent, simple design philosophy run by a small but amazing team. If you haven't checked it out, please do, and support them if you can.</p>

<p>Over the years I've had various levels of success at completing my projects, but have finally decided that I need to better catalog and track these projects. This website is my attempt to do just that. Lately, my kids have become a bigger part of these projects, so I expect to add things I do with them here as well. They're so creative, and have so many interesting ideas that it's hard for me to keep up with them. In fact, they probably wish I had more time to do the projects they'd like to have help with, but hey, there are only so many hours in a day.</p>
